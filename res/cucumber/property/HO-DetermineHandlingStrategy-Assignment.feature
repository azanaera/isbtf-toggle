  Scenario: Reassign an existing Homeowners claim through automated assignment
    Given a Homeowners claim
    And the claim segment is "Property - mid complexity"
    And the claim loss location is in state "California"
    # And gosu rules to automatically assign the claim: GCAP00010 - If the claim loss type is property, this rule uses the loss type and claim segment to get the top two matching group type choices for assigning this claim.
    When I reassign the claim through automated assignment
    Then the claim should be assigned to a user in "Property - TeamB" group
    Then the claim should be assigned to a user in "Claim Organization" group
