Feature: New Claim Creation ~ HOP_NewClaimCreation_Adjuster

  As an adjuster,
  I want to file claims against unverified policies.

  Background:
    Given I am a user with the "Adjuster" role

  Scenario: Filing a new Homeowners claim with a hail loss cause against an unverified policy
    # Given no existing "Homeowner" policy
    When I start filing a claim
    And I create an unverified Homeowners policy
    And I set claim loss cause to "Hail"
    And I finish filing the claim
    Then a "Homeowners" claim should be created
    And the claim loss cause should be "Hail"
    And the policy on the claim should be unverified

  Scenario: Filing a new Homeowners claim with a fire loss cause and an injury incident against an unverified policy
    # Given no existing "Homeowners" policy
    When I start filing a claim
    And I create an unverified Homeowners policy
    And I set claim loss cause to "Fire/Smoke"
    And I add a "Insured's loss" injury incident
    And I finish filing the claim
    Then a "Homeowners" claim should be created
    And the claim loss cause should be "Fire/Smoke"
    And an injury incident should be created on the claim
    And the injury loss party type should be "Insured's loss"
    And the policy on the claim should be unverified
